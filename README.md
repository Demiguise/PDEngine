Personal Development Engine

This is where I'm going to spend my next few months development my programming skills and experience/knowledge.
Making your own engine is a tough task but it's one I think I can do given enough time and will be a great benefit.
I've enjoyed using C# and unity but found that there are too many things that are done auto-magically for you, which 
I dislike. Thus, to get a better sense of how a game engine might work I will use this :)

There are a few core areas I want to flesh out before I even think about delving deeper into them.
(By 'Flesh Out' I mean that they must each perform a minimal task to be called 'Complete')

1. The Renderer
2. Physics
3. Audio

=======

- The Renderer

I'll initially be working with DX11 to make a renderer for this engine. I'm making sure that everything is as far removed
from each other as I can, in the event that I wish to change over to another renderer or have both in the same project.

Minimal Task -> Render out a box/Nyx model from EVE Online. No Textures, nothing special just a straight forward render
so I know I have something to work from.

- Physics

Pretty straight forward concept for a core engine area. I'm unsure how I'll deal with this but I'm sure it'll be a lot of 
fun working with physics again. I've not had to do it for quite some time :)

Minimal Task -> Two geometric objects (Sphere/Box) collide and react with each-other realistically.

- Audio

Another straight forward but mysterious area to develop onto. I've never looked into dealing with audio in any real 
capacity so I have no idea what to expect and how to access the different devices. Part of me believes it will be as
frustrating as dealing with DX11 has been.

Minimal Task -> Play an audio clip on game load, Mouse click with looping music in the background.
